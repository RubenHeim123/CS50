Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Brazil with 21.1% chance of winning. Because Belgium is more likely to win than Brazil

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I think 100000 because it does not use so much time but every team except of one shows up in the statistic. So its good enough in the prediction
